    /* **************Explanation and Hints************
     * void - This is a return type. This means that a function will not return anything. To use this we will type
     *        "void" before the name of the function when we are writing out the whole function.
     *
     * Rigidbody - When attached to a GameObject it adds things like gravity as well as other physics properties to the GameObject.
     *             For the bullet we want to attach the Rigidbody to it so that we can add a forward force to it when shooting it
     *           - To use the Rigidbody we need a variable. The type of this variable is "Rigidbody" instead of "int" and often this variable
     *             is named "rigidbody".
     *           - Now we need to get the reference to the Rigidbody. If we don't then it won't work. In order to get the reference we need to
     *             type in the Start function:
     *             
     *              *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* = GetComponent<Rigidbody>(); 
     *              
     *             Replace *nameOfRigidbodyVariable* with whatever name you gave the rigidbody variable.
     *                    
     * OnTriggerEnter - This is a special Unity function. It runs whenever a GameObject whose Box Collider is mark as being a trigger.
     *                  This means that when the bullet runs into another GameObject that has a rigidbody it will call this function.
     *                  Triggers are useful because they allow you to know when two things hit eachother without using any physics.
     *                  The parameter is useful because it gives us the reference of whatever the bullets hits. The function
     *                  is typed like this:
     * 
     *                    void OnTriggerEnter(Collider *name*)
     *                    {
     *                        //Run code here
     *                    }
     *
     *                    Replce *name* with what you want to call the Collision variable
     *
     * AddForce - This will add a force in the direction that is provided. It is also a part of Rigidbody. In this script
     *            we want to add force to the forward direction of this GameObject times the speed variable;
     *          - We'll do this by typing:
     *                  
     *                    *rigidbodyVariable*.AddForce(transform.forward * speed);
     *
     * Tag - Tags are used to identify GameObjects. In the inspector we can create new tags and set tags for GameObjects.
     *       In this project we will want to create two tags. First one is "Enemy" and the second one is "KillZone". Then
     *       we want to give the enemies the "Enemy" tag, give the player the "Player" tag, and give the KillZone the
     *       "KillZone" tag.
     *     - In the OnTriggerEnter function we will type an If statements. The conditional of this if statements will be
     *       comparing the passed in Collider variable's tag with the string "Enemy". We do this so
     *       we know what the bullet has hit. You will type out this If statements in the OnTriggerEnter function
     *       like this:
     *
     *       If(*colliderVariable*.transform.tag == "Write the tag here")
     *       {
     *          //Do stuff when this hits an GameObject with the tag specified above
     *       }
     *
     *       Replace *colliderVariable* with the name that you have given the Collider variable. Replace *stringOfTag*
     *       with either the "Enemy" tag.
     *
     * Destroy - This function will destroy whatever GameObject we pass in as a parameter. For example we
     *           will type:
     *           
     *           Destroy(gameObject);
     *           
     *           This will destroy the GameObject that this script is attached to.
